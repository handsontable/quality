### Performance lab
**Installation requirements**
- Cloned branch develop
- Running Docker
- Browser Chrome with Chrome WebDriverv in the same version as browser
   `webdriver-manager update --versions.chrome {version number here}`
- Update https://github.com/handsontable/performance-lab/blob/master/protractor.conf.js#L7 to the same version as Chrome
- Node v11
  
**Instalation**
First iTerm window
- `cd repo`
- `nvm use 11`
- `npm I`
- `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up` 
After that performance-lab-dbviewer i performance-lab-mongodb should be builed, if not, repeat last command

Second iTerm window (after above)
cd repo
- `./bin/hot-perf run --help`
- `./bin/hot-perf run --test-name=0.16.0-edit --hot-version=latest` // por√≥wnianie wersji 0.16 I 7.4.2
- `./bin/hot-perf run --test-name=0.12.0-edit --hot-version=latest`
- `./bin/hot-perf local-server benchmark-viewer`

Performance lab is running in the Chrome browser at `http://localhost:8083/`.

The performance lab uses Jasmine, but without the `expected` that is measured by this lab.

### Docs - locally
**Installation requirements**
- working Docker v2.3.02 configured with working Kitemanic
- node v8
- installed saas (`gem install saas`)
- configuration as described in repository of [handsontable/docs](https://github.com/handsontable/docs)


#### Launching an unreleased version of the documentation
There are two ways to do this.
First:
- On the branch `draft-next`
- `npm run start -- --hot-version=release/version` version e.g. 8.1.0
- `npm run build:next`

Second:
- clone builded package into `src/handsontable` and then
- `npm run build:next`

##### Updating demos in the docs
After above build, paste builded package with the correct Handsontable version into 
`generated/components/handsontable/dist/`

Check `Handsontable.version` in the browser console to be sure.
